# Nuxtjs Application
## please pay attention:
1. in this application i did not use vuex(insted of vuex i used 'props')
2. This project is not completed yet(maybe in the future maybe not(it depends :))
3. this project need a backend for running properly(i wrote a backend app with asp.net core but for some reason I decided not to share that) so feel free to use it with a backend application
4. this project Includes more than eighty components wich u can not use them without a backend(for example a component in created hook tries fetch data and if it fails  you will see some sort of expected and unxpected behavior  )
5. If you have read the above four , You can understand that a back end app is required
